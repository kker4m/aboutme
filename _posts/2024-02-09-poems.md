Poems I've done, migrated from [my twitter post](https://x.com/PrincessMortix/status/1698403266462150869). Updated at {{ page.update }}.

## Invisible ghosts

behind those eyes, hidden deep inside
is a darker shade of what they tryna hide
a dark shade full of demons
invisible demons

they've been fighting them for ages
they cant let it control them
must be strong
and most of the times, they dont let the demons out

surrounding their feelings
slowly, being assassined from inside to outside
how do i be so strong
like you are?

its an endless battle
that they must win
someday, somehow
it will be all over, forever

## adeus

é dificil pensar
que colegas que estiveram com você
desde o primario
simplismente fora embora

por incompetencia de um sistema
que te pressiona, oprime
tentam por agua oxigenada na ferida
esperando que tudo se resolva

panico, depressão, ansiedade
tudo isso, lentamente
matando aqueles que se foram
momentos que rapidamente, se foram

você aprende a dar valor quando perde
quando ama
quando gosta
o valor inimaginável de um colega de classe, perdido pela incompetencia do sistema.

## 彡96

listening to the same album
on repeat
playing the same song
again and again

as a wave in the wind
im still hearing sounds
time never stoos
all your efforts are trashed

tears aren't enough
days aren't enough
not even rest is enough
when you're down

i can hear you whispering inside
waiting for a light
im calling the void
_"are you okay?"_

---

## solitaria

completamente solitaria
no passado, no presente, no futuro
apenas sozinha
comigo e meus pensamentos

como tornei amiga disso?
eu não gosto disso
não escolhi que as coisas fossem assim
mas elas sempre acabam assim

tenho culpa de tudo isso
o incerto que está certo
não tem como fugir
do que vive dentro de você

como as coisas acabam assim?
é uma incerteza
mas sei que ficarei solitaria
é uma certeza

## knife party

how this could came to an end
something unique
between us
something special

sparkles doesnt glow anymore
the small point of faith fade
will it be the end
like that, dry and dust?

i wish you could talk to me
understand me
understand you
can we talk about?

sorry for this
sorry for letting you down
sorry for creating a friendship with you
_all i wanted to say was sorry to you_

---

## bleed

distracted, another knife hit me
again, another knife
lets count them
one, two, three knives

3 knives, out of the many
all inside my body
thrown knives
thru my body

and im bleeding from some
others, i've already bleeded
but the last one.. still hurts me
_i just want to do not be hurt again_

---

## demons

are they?
do they really care?
is it too much for them
right?

demons are getting stronger
unlike iself
it was only a weak and fateful scream
do i need pleh?

can we leave this battlefield
im enough of it
i cant fight anymore
but them wont stop

---

## emptyness

feeling something new but old
its empty, like the void
a void created by myself
and im getting closer everyday

i've been fighting these aliens for so long
to get away from this void
the more i try
the more weapons they get

"we will help you" they say
but that empty void
was created by themselves
while i was asleep
to make me fight against demons

and these demons wont stop
'til i die
they want my soul, my essence
they dont want myself
but a mask

## easter special

_series of 3 poems, for a friend._

### rebecca

hey my dear, s _lo_ w down a bit
im trying, trying to be myself
my head looks an a _v_ ovado, trying to
to became something better
for u & me
sometim _es_ i think too much
like a bittersweet feeling.

### unsaved file at 2am

unsure if i should try again
give _u_ more space,
unsure if thats right
give _so_ mething better,
unsure if its over
please give me a sign, a light
from these unsure bittersweet feelings

### 1am

here alone
close
to my empty toughts
so _much_ to handle
is this a dream?
to be with ya
the good and bad moments
all here w/ ya
wanna be the next easter
watching some citrus?

---

## stupid

how could i be so stupid, oh
so stupid
i've been over here
rolling dices with aphrodite

since you left, my air was given to cigarettes
i try my best to forget
but you're stuck here
and i cannot let you fade away from my memories

now, i have been drinking with cupid
thinking of you
thinking of what we had
how i could be so stupid?

i wish i still had you
i try to turn the page
i can't erase your face
i can't forget our memories

## rainy

it's sad and raining
do i love it?
hell yeah
but something isn't right

another lace was disrupted
i've wasted their time again
will we even come back?
i wish we could so

it's too new for me
having laces with someone
probably they're right
and the prophecy is true

but if you want to go back
you know where to find me
either inside a computer
or inside my graveyard

---

## rescue me

tired of everything being ill
maybe i am just cool
or i could just be
a borderline bitche

this endless war
are going too far
i've lost nothing
but everything

i wanna be loved
but its always too much
i'd take it all
to be again, normal

now shit has started
nothing to do about
even lost at this degree
would you rescue me?

## found ya

blizzard, blizzard
let us down again
i never thought about being
zapped by you
edged from my existence
raindrops of pain all over my skin

you said you would never do this
but every life is a lie
if we were tied up
how did we broke up?

at least now im going
even after every snowflake
causing the void death

are you scared of blizzards too?
or i've faded in your memory?

i've found you again!
